  <p>The .btn classes are designed to be used with the <code>&lt;button&gt;</code> element. However, you can also use these classes on <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;input&gt;</code> elements (though some browsers may apply a slightly different rendering).</p>

  <p>When using button classes on <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> elements that are used to trigger in-page functionality (like collapsing content), rather than linking to new pages or sections within the current page, these links should be given a role="button" to appropriately convey their purpose to assistive technologies such as screen readers.</p>
