  Alerts are available for any length of text, as well as an optional dismiss button. For proper styling, use one of the four <strong>required</strong> contextual classes (e.g., <code>.alert-success</code>). Use the <code>.alert-link</code> utility class to quickly provide matching colored links within any alert.
